What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of objects. An object is an instance of a class that encapsulates data and behavior. OOP is a way of organizing and designing software in a more modular and flexible way, allowing developers to build complex applications with reusable and maintainable code.

In Java, OOP is implemented through the use of classes and objects. A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects, which defines the attributes (data) and methods (behavior) of the objects. An object is an instance of a class, created from the blueprint or template.

OOP in Java is based on four fundamental principles:

Encapsulation - The idea of bundling data and methods together within a class, to protect the data from outside interference and manipulation.
Inheritance - The idea of creating new classes from existing ones, to reuse code and add additional functionality.
Polymorphism - The idea of allowing different objects to respond to the same message or method call in different ways.
Abstraction - The idea of modeling real-world objects by focusing only on the essential details and hiding unnecessary complexity.
// Object
Object is a real world entity. it's a instance of an object.
an object consist of state , behaviours,and identity.
identity->
// means particular things
such as man , women , car , dog 
example = A dog.
identity -> dog
state ->means attributes  breed,weight,color.
behaviours -> braking , eating, running.

State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.
