/*In Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting 
a base class, and as well as the derived class also acts as the 
base class for other classes. In the below image, class A serves as
a base class for the derived class B, which in turn serves as
a base class for the derived class C. In Java, a class cannot 
directly access the grandparentâ€™s members. */
