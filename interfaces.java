/* An Interfaces in java define as Abstract type use in
 * specify behaviours of the class. it's a blueprint of
 * the behaviours. java interfaces contains static constant and
 * abstract method.
 * An Interfaces in java is use to achieve the Abstraction.
 * Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the behaviour.
   Interface do not have constructor. 
   Represent behaviour as interface unless every sub-type of the class is guarantee to have that behaviour. 
   An Interface is about capabilities like a Player may be an interface and any class implementing Player must be able to (or must implement) move(). So it specifies a set of methods that the class has to implement.
   If a class implements an interface and does not provide method bodies for all functions specified in the interface, then the class must be declared abstract.
   A Java library example is Comparator Interface. If a class implements this interface, then it can be used to sort a collection.
   
   SYNTAX==>>
   interface {

    // declare constant fields
    // declare methods that abstract 
    // by default.   
}
Java Program demonstrate of interfaces.
